## Event

The `<Event >` component is made up of three subcomponents: `<EventHeader />`, `<EventBody />`, and `<EventInfo />`. These subcomponents are specificly design to be used in `<Event />`, but also can be used in `<EventTeaser />`.

`<EventInfo />` subcomponent consist of imported child components: `<EventArtist />`, `<EventPrices />`, `<EventVenue />` and `<EventDates />`. These four child components can be used independently or optionally based on the props passed into `<EventInfo />`. <>
