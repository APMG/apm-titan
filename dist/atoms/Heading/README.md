# Heading

### level prop

Passing in a number from `1` to `6` in level prop, it returns that number prop as an `<h1>` from `<h6>`, depending on the level of prop passed in.

### className prop

Passing in a string in `className` prop, returns that string prop as the className of `<heading />`. In some cases heading can be used without any hdg class if nothing past into props.
