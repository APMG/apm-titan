## Event Teaser

The `<EventTeaser />` component is made up of a atom component and subcomponents of `<Event />`: `<Heading />`, `<EventDates />`, and `<EventVenue />`. These components are displayed optionally based on the props passed into `<EventTeaser />`. Ex. `<EvenTeaser dates={eventDates} />` will render `<EventDates />` in `<EventTeaser />`.
